Data Analytics tools , Google Analytics , others available today free , , used correctly , help organizations save millions , maybe billions dollars sales marketing.How machine replace humans ? Before I go , I think ’ best level set constitutes machines . In context article , machines describe computers computerized equipment , like robots , programmed learn , sometimes like humans . Occasionally call Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) , times call machine learning , still times call robotics . And yes , technically different things . These bots efficient humans specific domains growing smarter passing day . They really tough tasks considered difficult human . But , within broad discussion related future work , totally interrelated . Factory floors deploy robots increasingly driven machine learning algorithms adjust people working alongside . A machine work efficiently abundant data information work imparted daily . But every forward step & advancement technology , threat proliferating , threat replaced work front . Every passing day sealing jobs humans globe . Similarly , AI used turn hand-drawn sketches ( done humans ) digital source code.Role Machines Companies future : Companies clearly developing AI robotics expertise idea technological innovations ’ able tocut costsincrease efficienciesoffer new value propositionsexecute new business models above.Of course , ’ machines creatives working together either . In another example , Amazon employed 100,000 robots warehouses efficiently move things around increased warehouse workforce 80,000 . Humans , Amazon ’ case , picking packing goods robots move orders around giant warehouses , essentially cutting “ walking required workers , making Amazon pickers efficient less tired. ” Plus , robots “ allow Amazon pack shelves together like cars rush-hour traffic longer need aisle space humans . The greater density shelf space means inventory one roof , means better selection customers. ” Why Machines replace humans ? During next decades ( maybe sooner ) , notion work whether handled human virtual hinge predictability . As starting today , machines manage routine humans take unpredictable – tasks require creativity , problem-solving , flexibility . In context , robotics seen means improve operations efficiency also improve quality life workers.Although obvious human factors involved work activity impact job automation , also true highly repetitive tasks—and even mechanical ones—are ideal robots . Besides greater efficiency speed , automation leads lower risk accidents , greater control autonomy , , fewer costs organizations.Are Machines diligent humans ? Although artificial intelligence machine learning make us believe robots endowed superior intelligence , fact ’ yet ability learn experience respond unknowns . So things stand , however much processing speed automatic learning robot , ’ beat factors innate human brain . Humans still essential part process . Think delivering services client . Most customer challenges routine , humans play important role addressing new issues , solving first time appear , consolidating process system.Machines vs . Humans – Which premium ? While machines humans placed proximity , robots expensive , ’ apply types , especially based Robotic Process Automation ( RPA ) , development process incorporates algorithms significantly reduce costs.Moreover , think domestic robots—be vacuum cleaner , lawn mower pool cleaner—are increasingly part daily lives .

The reason advancements fields related data analysis . The field AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing staggering pace , fields become popular buzzwords days.Buzzwords originated technical terms often underlying essence ignored fashionable use mainly used impress . This main reason misconception amongst people . AI , ML , Stats , Data Mining , many fields related analysis data often mistook one thing , thus words often used interchangeably convey one thing . But true ! The similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “ information ” .In academics , learning AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining , academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored , case articles try explain difference . Thus , becoming primary cause confusion learners . Hence , article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines rather wandering technical definitions . Then difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining ? The essential difference disciplines lies “ aims ” approach taken achieve aims.The aims fields explained detail following sections : Artificial Intelligence : The aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities . Then satisfy aim , must first understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent ? The answer questions found studying intelligent agents best example intelligent agent found standing front mirror ! Yes ! Humans best examples intelligent entities . Thus , 1900s , researchers began exploring thought process , reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent . Mimicking human behavior became aim AI initial years research . After setting goal , studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test ! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks , sufficient fool interrogator . But test received criticism mimicking human behavior exactly intelligence . Because intelligence related working human brain without human brain , intelligence meaning ! Thus , mimicking human thought processes reasoning became transformed aim . The field Psychology philosophy also resonate aim understand human thought process . The difference AI tries understand thought process mimic , build . The collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks try mimic function neurons present human brain . So , basically , initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent.Concurrently , field computer science developing greater pace . With advances computer science , experiments theories could easily tested validated . As programs applied solve real-life problems , found computers performed better humans tasks really complex humans . One best examples could chess-playing program . An AI program defeated world ’ best chess player Garry Kasparov . This incident indicated human intelligence ultimate intelligence else human would able defeat AI program . This leads question , human intelligence ideal intelligence ? As computers became advanced , proved better humans certain complex tasks . That new definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems . So , rather considering nature agents , researchers began study nature intelligence . Then question comes test validate intelligence ? The best way test intelligence solve cognitive problems . An agent said intelligent solve complex problem . The problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers . Thus , researchers began studying ideal intelligence , selected agent validate experiments computer . So , computer problem-solving approach adopted . So , human-centered approach computer , problem-solving approach two main aims AI . Both fields contributed field giving valuable insights.Both aims important collaboratively form main aim AI ! Machine Learning : In problem-solving approach , big challenge AI overcome order achieve aim . Consider example solving math problem . There two cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach . Let us say two math problems given solve . The first problem familiar second problem not.Consider first problem . The first problem familiar , means know solve kind problems already solved similar problems past . So , comes question , mind able solve problem ? The answer , solved similar problems past , thus learned past data , solve problems , thus even ’ seen problem past , still able solve similar problems . This one form intelligence.Consider another case given second problem solved kind problems past . Then solve problem , try consciously gather manipulate given information reach certain conclusion . This kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process . This second kind intelligence.For AI build intelligent agents , kinds intelligence must developed agent . But , reality AI reached point able build agents learn past data find useful information . AI today reached point build agents think . That second type intelligence.So , way AI able implement first type intelligence Machine Learning ! So , domain AI focuses solely implementing first kind intelligence fact Machine Learning . That reason ML called subset AI ! So , main difference AI ML.Technically speaking , “ It field study gives computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions , patterns without explicitly programmed ” . This statement needs elaboration . The essence ML related process “ Generalization ” learning past data . Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims . Consider humans recognize daily life objects . If see animal , easily recognize “ dog ” “ cat ” . It trivial task us ever wondered mind able ? The answer Generalization ! If given picture dog , easily recognize picture dog , , minds abstracted description dog formulated “ concept ” dog concepts became better better learned past experiences dog . So , way think dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds.With generalization , come real “ information ” . So , try give computers ability generalize “ raw data ” convert “ information ” patterns trends data . Statistics : This discipline concerns collection , organization , analysis , interpretation , presentation data . Statistics tries deal data aim explain . So , study explaining data ! Statistics two main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics.Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data thus name “ Descriptive ” statistics . It tries explain much information possible , easily whole large data would complex task otherwise . Inferential statistics try make accurate inferences available small data . We use inference many tasks daily lives . Consider simple case cooking soup . After completing recipe , taste small sample , , spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad . Depending upon result sample , make inference whole soup soup whole , good bad . Similarly , statistics , cases apply inference meaningful information . For example , consider case gather whole data time-consuming costly . In cases , applying inference based available sample introduces uncertainty . That inferential statistics come help.So , use data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals . So , however , whatever data , statistics tries explain data . This aim resonate AI ML , statistics help fields correctly interpret data ! Data Mining : “ Data ” , useful raw form . Consider examples sensors used industrial applications . These sensors might used manufacturing plant sense different properties like temperature , pressure , etc . The raw data generated sensors useful unless converted suitable form , processed , analyzed gather valuable insights , used solve problem ! Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets , gather insights , Data Mining also referred “ Knowledge Discovery ” . That , Carly Fiorina , former CEO Hewlett-Packard said , “ The goal turn data information information Insight ” . This statement completely explains aim Data Mining ! So , difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims . But approaches taken fields , help one way fulfilling aims fields . This beauty fields !

Whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years , research ’ able answer questions relating nature emotions experiences.HistoryBeginning within late nineteenth century , time psychological queries driven philosophical understanding mind , typically equated consciousness . As result , analysis brain behavior naturally thought role consciousness behavioral management brain.The Ancient Mayans among first propose sorted feeling degree consciousness , purpose , worldly association mankind . Since consciousness incorporates stimuli nature well interior stimuli , Mayans trusted essential type existence , equipped evolution . The Incas , however , thought consciousness movement mindfulness well worry others too.John Locke , early philosopher , said consciousness , individuality , freelanced substances . He also detected reason believe consciousness stuck specific body mind , consciousness transferred one body mind different one . Karl Marx , another early thinker , denies mind-body classification holds consciousness jeopardized material eventualities one ’ settings . William James , American psychologist , differentiated consciousness stream – unbroken continuous despite several changes shifts.While main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors throughout primary half twentieth century , analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s.In Sigmund Freud ’ psychoanalytic theory , see believed three levels awareness- preconscious , conscious , unconscious responsible one ’ behavior thinking . He believed mid divided three parts- id , ego , superego . The Id present birth , instinctual , operates according pleasure principle . The ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy . Finally , superego internalization society ’ moral standards responsible guilt . Now , Id regarded unconscious , whereas ego superego also conscious preconscious . Freud constantly revised clinical qualities researches , however , ’ conduct scientific experiments hence work heavily scrutinized , leaving questions unanswered . Sigmund Freud ’ theory differed psychologists since theories understandable easily conveyed people . Sigmund Freud ’ work hypotheses helped people shape perspectives youth , character , memory , sexuality , therapy . However , theories subject considerable criticism life . Whilst John Locke William James took practical approach mystery conducting experiments , Sigmund Freud ’ provide evidence support claims.BrainToday , essential focal point consciousness research understanding consciousness implies biologically mentally . Issues interest include phenomena perception , blindsight , brainwaves sleep , altered states consciousness produced psychoactive drugs.A greater part test assesses consciousness approaching human subjects verbal report encounters . However , confirm criticalness verbal reports , researchers must contrast action happens brain —that , search neural connections consciousness.Hope locate noticeable action specific aspect brain , particular pattern global brain activity , greatly predictive consciousness mindfulness . A brain imaging strategies , example , EEG MRI scans , utilized physical proportions brain activities examinations.A investigations shown movement essential primary sensory areas brain ’ adequate create consciousness : workable subjects report absence awareness event , areas , example , primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions stimulus . Higher brain areas viewed encouraging , particularly prefrontal cortex , involved range high order functions.One mainstream theory implicates various examples brain waves creating various conditions consciousness . Analysts record mind waves , drawings electrical movement inside cerebrum , using electroencephalograph ( EEG ) placing electrodes scalp . The four types brain waves ( alpha , beta , theta , delta ) correspond one mental state ( relaxed , alert , lightly asleep , deeply asleep ) MemoryEpisodic memory regarded form conscious memory . This capacity consciously remember personally experienced events situations past . The hippocampus located brain ’ temporal lobe responsible type memory.Consciousness also plays part important memory distinctions . One distinction implicit explicit characteristics ; explicit memory consciously know implicit memory includes events may conscious of.Furthermore , several empirical findings suggest declarative memory related consciousness well ; meaning retrieval formation memory connected awareness . Working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information well since temporarily stores tampers information whilst working tasks.The current ways testing information lacking several essential aspects , including spatial resolution , temporal resolution , scope . Examples methods PET , fMRI , EEG , implanted electrodes , etc.PET fMRI temporal resolution problems , EEG well-known localizability difficulties , implanted electrodes whilst great temporal spatial resolution test set number neurons ; , restricted scope . Hence , huge numbers speculations , testable fundamental level , appear difficult test now.Mental illnessConsciousness influence way see objects around us , encourages us settle choices communicate . Experiencing difficulty perceiving objects connected problems , example , agnosia ( failure decipher visual data ) , Alzheimer ’ disease , autism . However , actually ’ comprehend visual data basic mind intentionally perceive object.Several different disorders consciousness include locked-in syndrome , minimally conscious state , persistent vegetative state , chronic coma , brain death.Locked-in syndrome , otherwise called pseudo coma , condition wherein patient aware however ’ move impart verbally complete loss motion essentially voluntary muscles body aside vertical eye developments squinting . The individual conscious able speak eye movements.In minimally conscious state , patient intermittent periods awareness wakefulness . Patients need give restricted , however reproducible indications consciousness themself current circumstance . This could following straightforward orders , comprehensible speech , purposeful conduct.In persistent vegetative state , patient sleep-wake cycles , lacks awareness , able communicate , displays reflexive non-purposeful behavior . The term refers organic body able grow develop devoid intellectual activity social intercourseLike coma , chronic coma results generally cortical white-matter harm neuronal axonal injury , central brainstem sores . Usually , metabolism grey matter decreases 50-70 % normal range . The patient lies eyes shut ’ know self environmental factors.Brain death irreversible end brain activity , function ( including involuntary activity necessary sustain life ) . The main cause total necrosis cerebral neurons following loss brain oxygenation . After brain death patient lacks sense awareness ; sleep-wake cycles behavior , typically look dead deep sleep state.Future predictions conclusionAs see history scholar ’ endeavors study consciousness empirically , nature one defined using scientific methods . In past , psychologists Descartes came dualistic theories line fundamental laws physics . In battle realists illusionists , taking sides fundamentally impossible topic ’ allow concrete evidence.As observe neural examinations brain detect causes consciousness , sensory sector brain cause one aware certain event even clear signs reaction stimulus . Similarly , even though consciousness plays major role memory , currently lack facilities research fully . In future , possibility able access facilities , however , could allow us find neural connections ties mental illness well . Not would help several people making us aware causes perspective certain things , would also give us better chance recognizing signs possible mental illness issues beforehand.As seems , researchers continue study unknown part mind able fund recover global pandemic , able answer one psychology ’ difficult questions.Blackcoffer Insights 21 : Amara Arora Vaanya Kaushal , Scottish High International School', 'Nature blessed humanity earth , rounded globe essential necessity lies hand human .

Widespread implementation data-mining seen recently countries opting Government-regulated surveillance applications monitor movement times . Moreover , applications access personal information well medical records .

Video games existence since early 1970s become increasingly popular , spanning different mobile ( smartphones , tablets ) stationary ( computer console ) platforms . Advances , particularly mobile devices , given birth social networks group gamingAlthough nature gaming require physical stamina therefore limited factors age , gender , fitness , popular adolescents . In 2018 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) classified gaming disorder International Classification Diseases ( ICD-11 ) . The ICD-11 list diseases medical conditions aids health professionals making diagnoses treatment plans patients various disorders . It noted , inclusion gaming disorder ICD-11 WHO generated vigorous sometimes contentious debate discussion within medical mental health community . Although recognized area clinical interest , Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 ) published American Psychiatric Association suggests clinical research required Gaming Disorder formally considered psychiatric disorder . Similarly , WHO notes inclusion gaming disorder ICD-11 , encourage research excessive gaming behavior , including prevention treatment.What Online gaming disorder ? 2018 WHO draft 11th Revision ICD-11 denotes disorder pattern “ digital-gaming ” “ video-gaming ” behavior characterized impaired control gaming activity , increasing priority given gaming activities extent gaming takes precedence interests daily activities , continuation escalation gaming despite occurrence negative consequences.Online Gaming disorder similarities Internet gaming disorder ( IGD ) , condition American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) noted DSM-5 area need additional study . The APA currently recognize IGD official condition . For gaming disorder diagnosed , WHO criteria require behavioral pattern gamer must sufficient severity major noticeable impairment deterioration personal , family , social , educational , occupational important areas functioning present minimum 12 months.Signs symptoms Online gaming disorderAccording WHO definition , person online gaming disorder demonstrate following characteristics least 12 months ; problems controlling control gaming habits , seeing gaming important necessities daily activities work , continuing engage gaming even negative health social problems identified evident . Further research shows gaming disorders also linked anxiety , depression , obesity , sleeping disorders , stress . People remain physically inactive long periods gaming may also higher risk obesity , sleep disorders , health-related issues , according WHO [ 1 ] .Health consequences video Online gamingVideo game-related health problems cause continuous strain injuries , skin disorders , health issues . Other problems according Shoja et al . ( 2007 ) , include condition could termed video game-provoked seizures patients pre-existing epilepsy . The following health consequences video gaming reported.Vision issuesVideo game playing associated eye problems . Extensive fixed staring video game screen causes eyestrain cornea , pupil , iris biologically equipped chronic heavy viewing digital images electronic devices . The visual system strain frequent video game use extended periods may result headaches , dizziness , cases , nausea vomiting . Interestingly , research shows gamers enhancement spatial distribution attention , compared non-gamers . This somewhat predictable practice effect occurs peripheral central visual attention . For sufferers amblyopia ( dimness blurring eyesight due fault transmission eye brain ) video games may helpful.Musculoskeletal problemsPersistent gamers may also suffer musculoskeletal problems .

Furthermore , another case report New England Journal Medicine reported fracture base fifth metatarsal people play Wii video games . This condition termed ( perhaps sarcastically ) , Wii fracture . There also postural problems associated persistent playing video games , although , ergonomic measures ( including chair monitor position ) could potentially improve postural problems associated video game playing.Obesity overweightPlaying video games consistently associated obesity . This maybe related lack physical activity players . Alternatively , could less physically fit obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities , gaming . In either case , several studies linked television video games increased Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . It estimated children United States spend 25 % waking hours watching either television playing video games . Furthermore , children watch hours television play video games highest incidence obesity . If video games replacing physical activities young people participate physical recreation see playing video games form recreation , may part link times spent playing video games rise BMI teenagers . Evidence potential link gains support German study reporting boys spend 1.5 hours per day engaged television watching playing video games , 75.4 % less likely overweight spend 1.5 hours engaged activity.In 2011 study , association video game activity increase ( mostly junk ) food intake reported . Specifically , single video game sessions caused increase food intake , regardless appetite . It also suggested active video game play using two popular gaming platforms opposite effect . Other researchers found evidence active video games would result beneficial outcome although study demonstrate increase amount physical activity within children receiving active video games.Seizures ( Epileptic ) Health concerns video games may cause epileptic seizures started early 1980s . The first medically documented case video game-induced seizure reported 1981 . In 1993 , story popular press ( Sun newspaper ) reported boy choked death vomit seizure triggered playing video game .

The visibility autochthonous politicians work years nurture , celebrities already descend political sphere . In one best-known instances celebrity transitioning politics , Ronald Reagan walked away Hollywood White House , carrying trademark charismatic on-screen personality spilled politics . Initially serving governor California 15 years late 1960s , Reagan served two terms Oval Office .

The state public healthcare system , still vast , fragmented scale rapidly enough face challenge pandemic COVID-19 . The origin public healthcare lies British colonial period facilities provided British officers families stationed India . From 1960s onwards , independent government India stressed upon healthcare led creation modern public healthcare system India . The healthcare system organized primary , secondary , tertiary levels . At primary level Sub Centre ’ Primary Health Centre ’ ( PHCs ) . At secondary level Community Health Centre ’ ( CHCs ) smaller Sub-District hospitals . Finally , top level public care provided government tertiary level , consists Medical Colleges District/General Hospitals . The number PHCs , CHCs , Sub Centre ’ , District Hospitals increased past six years , although standards set Indian Public Health Standards . But still critical challenges existing system.One major areas lack awareness diseases , especially communicable diseases among general population India . This challenge becomes complicated lower strata society , especially poor households , migrant laborers homeless people proper channels communication available get necessary information health experts . Add low educational status , poor functional literacy , low accent education within healthcare system , low priority health population , among others see magnitude problem . According recent study initiated faculty students IIT-Hyderabad IIT-Bombay , Tier-1 cities , found 12 percent respondents switched public private mode third week COVID-19 . This modal shift 9 percent Tier-2 cities 7 percent Tier-3 cities . Moreover , nearly 48 percent people said travel work third week March , whereas 28 percent frequency travel work . When inquired cancellation trips cities using major modes transportation , around 18 percent said cancelled flights whereas , 20 per cent respondents cancelled train journeys . This indicates awareness COVID-19 higher Tier-1 cities , comparison Tier-2 Tier-3 cities . But national level , state level door-to-door campaigns along targeted media campaigns may enable knowledge pandemic spread fast among local populace.The second challenge access public healthcare India . Access ( healthcare ) defined Oxford dictionary “ The right opportunity use benefit ( healthcare ) ” Physical reach one basic determinants access , defined “ ability enter healthcare facility within 5 km place residence work ” . Using definition , study India 2012 found rural areas , 37 % people able access IP facilities within 5 km distance , 68 % able access out-patient facilities . Furthermore , postulated general , rustic ( rural ) one ’ existence – one lives towns – greater odds disease , malnourishment , weakness , premature death.The third planning portion related preparedness pandemic .

The “ mid ” scenario suggests increase 13 million ( 7.4 million high-income countries ) . Though estimates remain highly uncertain , figures indicate substantial rise global unemployment . For comparison , global financial crisis 2008-9 increased unemployment 22 million . While self-employment typically react economic downturns , acts “ default ” option survival maintaining income – often informal economy . For reason , informal employment tends increase crises . However , current limitations movement people goods may restrict type coping mechanism.Labour supply declining quarantine measures fall economic activity . At point , preliminary estimate suggests infected workers already lost nearly 30,000 work months , consequent loss income ( unprotected workers ) . Employment impacts imply large income losses workers . Overall losses labour income expected range 860 3,440 billion USD . The loss labour income translate lower consumption goods services , detrimental continuity businesses ensuring economies resilient . Working poverty also likely increase significantly . The strain incomes resulting decline economic activity devastate workers close poverty line . The growth impacts virus used unemployment estimates suggest additional 8.8 million people working poverty around world originally estimated ( i.e . overall decline 5.2 million working poor 2020 compared decline 14 million estimated pre-COVID-19 ) . Under mid high scenarios , 20.1 million 35.0 million people working poverty pre-COVID-19 estimate 2020.Who particularly vulnerable ? Epidemics economic crises disproportionate impact certain segments population , trigger worsening inequality . Based past experience current information COVID-19 pandemic insights previous crises , number groups identified : Those underlying health conditions older people risk developing serious health issues.Young persons , already facing higher rates unemployment underemployment , vulnerable falling labor demand , witnessed global financial crisis .

The virus already disproportionately impacting poor wealthy countries , known cases concentrated . Experts urging world prepare lend extra support low-income countries address pandemic . COVID-19 cases likely go undetected under-detected developing countries fewer resources available tackle pandemic . Countries large poor populations including Brazil , India , Indonesia , Nigeria , Pakistan confirmed cases , slow respond threat , according NPR . Preventative care health education less accessible low-income people likely pre-existing conditions , catch COVID-19 , die . People living poverty also likely hold insecure jobs afford stay home sick work.In times crisis , International Labour Standards provide strong foundation key policy responses focus crucial role decent work achieving sustained equitable recovery mitigate impacts COVID-19 world work . These standards , adopted representatives governments , workers ’ employers ’ organizations , provide human-centered approach growth development , including triggering policy levers stimulate demand protect workers enterprises.Policy responses focus two immediate goals : Health protection measures economic support demand- supply-side associated cause.First , workers employers families protected health risks COVID-19 . Protective measures workplace across communities introduced strengthened , requiring large-scale public support investment.Second , timely , large-scale , coordinated policy efforts taken provide employment income support stimulate economy labor demand . These measures cushion enterprises workers immediate employment income losses , also help prevent chain supply shocks ( e.g . losses workers ’ productivity capacities ) demand shocks ( e.g . suppressing consumption among workers families ) could lead prolonged economic recession.In challenging times , many countries come forward protect workers workplace decisive measures combat spread disease , ameliorating pernicious effect economy labor market across three policy pillars : protecting workers workplace , stimulating economy labor demand , supporting employment income . Some policies include Working arrangements , including telework ; Occupational Safety Health ( OSH ) advice ; Expanded access paid sick leave ; Prevention discrimination exclusion .

What factor made Indians accept British government ? The perception British-policies ( trading , pay-scale , positioning military ) done various marketing channels way brainwashed people nation , many ready accept British . So Marketing like fire smartly handled ; destroy enemies , burn . Marketing design develop pathway product service customer product , price , place promotion strategies . Marketing depends variety parameters classified broadly , boiling vital three . These ‘ What type customer marketing team focusing ( based gender , age , location , customer-class ) ( W1 ) ’ , ‘ What Product Specification Applications need bring front customer ( W2 ) ’ , ‘ What Product Promotion flow path ( W3 ) ’ , ‘ How much time takes convey product information customer ( H1 ) ’ . These criteria I call ‘ 3W1H ’ forms . These basics need taken care developing marketing strategy upcoming product . However , enough ? No . There one parameter called Feedback mechanism ( FM ) . Generally , machines use feedback mechanism check output generated per input given , input corrected get required output . When comes human beings , he/she surrounded multiple products daily social media , TV advertising forth . Slight uncertainties either side observation make positive negative impact product consumer ’ mind . In feedback mechanism , marketing team needs answer one question “ What kind product image built customer mind promotional activities ? ” If product image built per expectation , management review work 3W1H , discussed earlier . So let ’ elaborate 3W1H approach works along feedback mechanism . Fig.1- 3W1H FM process target customer effectively After deciding customer range , work activities . Since customer conscious purchasing product product promoted , first thing customer check usefulness , his/her answer ‘ Yes , ’ customer start comparing similar alternative products market . Therefore , one present product along unique thought express product way image imprinted consumer mind . For example , polio campaign India . The government taken initiative make India polio-free spreading awareness types social communication mediums , Television played vital role . Legendary cinema actor ‘ Amitabh Bachchan ’ selected ambassador campaign . Initially , advertisement published Amitabh pleaded people vaccinating children within fixed schedule . The advertisement circulated throughout nation , stone kept unturned government make campaign successful . However , much surprise , advertising failed miserably attract deprived community polio booth . This promotion failure non-consideration customer ( W1 ) advertise impacted application customer ( W2 ) ? So analysing failure , experts recommended changes marketing campaign like , focus major customer ( Here mainly village woman generally spend time home watching TV ) , type impact people ( People watched TV era , image Amitabh ‘ Angry young man ’ ) . So campaign improved advertising bringing angry Amitabh instead soft-image , used earlier campaign . So next polio campaign number people polio booth suddenly increased feedback taken people sudden change , replied ’ want watch ‘ Amitabh sir ’ getting angry us . [ ] In W3 , organisation must focus kind channel use attract customer . Currently , lot platforms available market product . The main agenda keep mind effectively engage customer marketing , first , make impact customer , show interest product . For example , changes launching trailers upcoming films . Till 20th century Television newspaper crucial factors , along television , marketing team take help internet resources like Youtube , Facebook , introducing article pre-trailer phenomenon . Increasing range promotional devices , broadcast formats publishing platforms provide broad range promote film choosing right platform may lead massive hit box-office . For last factor ( H1 ) time , obvious question comes mind ‘ Is time advertising matters ? ’ , While watching TV advertisement appears , many times change channel instead watching whole ad ignore altogether . You option ‘ Skip ad ’ watch anything online , one must decide much time required deliver product information promotion ? Delivering product information less time , may create possibility customer watch result attracting customers . So , content king marketing . However , one must guessed , work time . Other factors like cost product , application range , type customer also affect H1 . For example , customer would conscious watching higher-priced product broadcast compare lower-priced one . So would take time marketing team convince customer buy expensive good lower-priced one.After implementing marketing strategy per 3W1H , need work feedback mechanism organization collect information product image generated customer ’ minds dealers using feedback-form . Not using feedback mechanism may lead failure achieving ‘ product sales target ’ make situation even worse . Take example ‘ THE TATA Nano-MAKING OF WORLD ’ S CHEAPEST CAR , ’ mind-blowing one-of-a-kind projects Indian automobile industry . From first phase marketing campaign , TATA Nano much continuous limelight project pleased former American president Barack Obama . [ ii ] The curiosity product high sale then-leading car model Maruti-800 dropped 20 % immediately unveiling Nano . [ iii ] However , marketing product , organization built “ Affordable , Garibo Ki Car ” image customer ’ mind , made customers conscious status-quo society buying Nano ? Thus , started giving preference two-wheelers Nano . During time , instances Nanos catching fire came focus , worsened situation . This case even exacerbates team work feedback mechanism hence , able change customer perception Nano . Later , Nano fire problem technically sorted even , marketing team make impactful effort market improved safety car . Therefore , customer ’ negative perception remained stuck organization even come close achieving selling figures Nano . If organization used feedback mechanism , would entirely different story . So 3W1H essential factor developing marketing strategy product along reversible FM method .

Using predictive analysis problems solved lead reduced costs efficient management finances . Better staff allocation admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement daily operations healthcare organizations . By using big data effect recency bias could reduced well . When give importance recent events tend ignore effect older ones , may lead incorrect decisions . This known recency bias . Big data also helps preventing fraudulent activities turn prevents losses insurance companies . Challenges While changing healthcare industry better , easy reap benefits big data . There whole lot challenges vulnerabilities attached implementation . One biggest challenges security . Healthcare big data contains personal information health history patients . Acts hacking , cyber theft phishing pose serious threat databases . Such data could stolen sold huge sums money . Protection patients ’ privacy hence serious challenge big data implementation . Also , data would contain external data apart medical information . The organization , therefore , take care privacy , legal compliances , government policies . Privacy security patients given utmost importance breach kind permitted.The next challenge data classification modeling . The size data massive less structured heterogeneous . Classifying massive data identify relevant information big challenge . Modeling unstructured data equally difficult . Storage retrieval another major challenge . Huge cloud servers sufficient space required store voluminous data . Also , speed high uploading data done hassle-free . The way storage challenge , retrieval also matter concern . Integrating data getting relevant systems link tough job . The next challenge major one opinion . Finding right talent expertise implement modern technology arduous task . Shortage required talent crisis market today . Even hiring right talent challenge retain . Scarce resources like data scientists hard find even harder retain . They easily poached competitors .
